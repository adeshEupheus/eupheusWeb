              Mathematics, as a subject, poses multiple challenges to students
              in a classroom. It plays a dominant role in our everyday life. The

              series for Grades 6 to 10 has been created in adherence to the
              guidelines provided by NCERT. The concept of the lab manual is to
              replace the rote learning approach and create a fun-to-do style of
              learning that makes mathematics more relatable and an
              easy-to-grasp subject. The method used in the lab manual is
              effective, interesting, and enjoyable.
              <br />
              The series helps stimulate a childâ€™s thinking abilities and
              encourages participatory and experiential learning. It aims to
              enable the child to become a self-reliant learner; it covers
              different areas to improve overall mathematical awareness.
