              Extensive research has shown that school-going children need to
              carry lighter school bags to class. With this objective in mind,
              it has been suggested that learning in the primary school segment
              be divided into terms or semesters. An efficient way to do this is
              to integrate learning across disciplines in the primary classes
              over the academic year into two or three books in a progressive
              manner. Thus, the learner needs to carry only one term book to
              school for each term.

              an integrated semester book series, has been designed by Eupheus
              Learning to implement this ideology according to the
              recommendations of the National Education Policy, 2020. This
              semester book series is a set of two books for two semesters for
              Grades 1 to 5. It integrates English, Mathematics, Environmental
              Studies, General Knowledge, and Computer Science for Grades 1 and
              2 and English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, General
              Knowledge, and Computer Science for Grades 3 to 5. Concord has a
              child-centred approach and builds in the principles of Multiple
              Intelligences and 21st century skill development. It integrates
              HOTS-based formative assessments and Life Skill development as the
              learning philosophy that integrates the various subjects
              seamlessly.
