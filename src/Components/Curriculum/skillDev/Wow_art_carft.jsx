              is a unique series that makes a sincere effort to ‘teach art’ and
              not just ‘do art’. It is being increasingly felt by educationists
              that ART not only promotes an aesthetic sense but also broadens
              knowledge. It has been proven that learning of art develops a
              number of life skills like patience, perseverance, creativity,
              problem-solving, anger management, tolerance, peace, etc.
