              "While the core educational services are fully exempt from GST,
              the definition of educational services is limited to services
              provided by educational institutions to its students, faculty and
              staff. Our expectation is to review this and make this more
              inclusive for entities catering to educational services as well.
              The edtech companies should get support on the GST so that these
              solutions can be made more affordable and used by a much larger
              student base democratizing access to quality education.
              Furthermore, to support adoption of technology, we would expect
              the government to review special incentives/ schemes to enhance
              the ecosystem."

              Madhav Agnihotri is like any other nine-year-old his age. He loves
              to read, play outdoors and watch cartoons. And yet, when he sits
              in front of his laptop, his mind is busy juggling codes and
              fingers are carefully stringing instructions together. The class 3
              student of DPS, Noida started coding just around the same time
              when he started framing sentences into paragraphs. "I love coding
              because it allows me to create something," says Agnihotri. A few
              months back he created a stress-buster app when he saw his elder
              sister buckling under the pressure of studies.
